## Reconnaissance

Create a directory to collect the scan results `nmap`:

Run a quick initial nmap scan to see which ports are open and which services are running on those ports.

```md
nmap -sC -sV -O -oA nmap/initial 10.10.10.4
```

- <b>-sC</b>: run default nmap scripts
- <b>-sV</b>: detect service version
- <b>-O</b>: detect OS
- <b>-oA</b>: output all formats and store in file nmap/initial

We got 3 open ports:

- <b>135</b>: RPC (Remote Policy Calls) client server communication
- <b>139</b>: SMB protocol (Server Message Block protocol)
- <b>445</b>: Microsoft Directory Services for Active Directory (AD) and for the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol over TCP/IP)

![Scan results](./img/nmap-01.png)

Three files containing the complete scan results have been created in `nmap` directory: `initial.gnmap`, `initial.nmap`, and `initial.xml`.
