## Reconnaissance

Create a directory to collect the scan results `nmap`:

Run a quick initial nmap scan to see which ports are open and which services are running on those ports.

```md
nmap -sC -sV -O -oA nmap/initial 10.10.10.4
```

Three files containing the scan results have been created in `nmap` directory: `initial.gnmap`, `initial.nmap`, and `initial.xml`.

[Download](./scan-results/initial.nmap) `initial.nmap`.
